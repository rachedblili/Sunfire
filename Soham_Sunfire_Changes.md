#Video Generation API with User Limits
##Project Purpose
This project is a Video Generation API that allows users to upload images and generate custom videos based on various parameters like narration, music, and image modifications. The goal is to provide users with an easy way to create videos using their own media files.

To ensure fair use and prevent overuse or abuse of the system, this API limits how many times a user can generate a video each day. This also helps in maintaining server performance, making the system more efficient for all users.

##Why the Changes Were Made
In the initial version of the code, users could generate an unlimited number of videos, which could lead to overloading the system. To prevent abuse, we’ve implemented a daily video limit for each user. Each user can now generate up to 10 videos per day. After reaching the limit, they’ll be asked to come back the next day to generate more.

##Key Changes Introduced

##User Tracking with Sessions:

What was added?: A method to uniquely track users.
Why?: We need to know who is using the app so we can track how many videos they’ve generated in a day.
Impact: Each user is identified by their IP address and browser (user agent). This allows the system to enforce limits for each individual user.

##Rate Limiting with Flask-Limiter:

What was added?: A rate limiting system.
Why?: To ensure no user can generate more than 10 videos a day.
Impact: Prevents any user from overloading the system. If they hit the limit, they are blocked from generating more videos until the next day.

##User Activity Tracking (user_data):

What was added?: A dictionary to track how many videos each user has generated.
Why?: To ensure the user cannot exceed their 10-video limit for the day.
Impact: This mechanism keeps track of the date and the count of videos generated by each user, ensuring fair use.

##Generating a Unique User ID:

What was added?: A way to create a unique ID for each user.
Why?: We need to identify each user without requiring them to log in.
Impact: Users are identified based on their IP address and browser. This ensures that even without logging in, each user is treated uniquely.

##Tracking Video Generation with update_user_session:

What was added?: Logic to track how many videos a user has generated today.
Why?: This is the core function that limits users to 10 videos per day.
Impact: Each time a user generates a video, their count is updated. If they hit 10, they are blocked from generating more that day.

##Rate Limiting for Video Generation Route:

What was added?: A restriction to limit video generation requests.
Why?: This ensures users are prevented from submitting more than 10 requests per day, adding an extra layer of protection.
Impact: If a user submits more than 10 requests, they get a 403 error (access denied), ensuring the system is not overwhelmed by any single user.

##General Flow Changes to Track Usage:

What was added?: A flow to ensure all steps—from identifying the user to generating the video—work together to enforce the limits.
Why?: It was necessary to modify the flow to ensure the tracking happens correctly and the system is protected.
Impact: The system now has a smooth process for checking limits, generating videos, and keeping track of usage, all working together seamlessly.

##Feedback to Users:

What was added?: Clear messages to inform users of their status.
Why?: So users know how many videos they’ve generated and when they’ve hit their limit.
Impact: Users are kept informed with messages like “You have generated 5 videos today” or “You have reached your limit, come back tomorrow,” enhancing the user experience.

##How the Changes Help

These changes are crucial for:

Preventing System Overload: By limiting each user to 10 videos per day, we ensure that no single user can dominate the system resources, keeping the service smooth and available for everyone.
Fair Use: The limit ensures that all users get a fair chance to use the service, preventing abuse by anyone attempting to generate too many videos.
Scalability: With these controls in place, the system can scale to handle more users without slowing down or crashing.
Clear User Experience: Users are always aware of how many videos they have generated and when they can generate more, making the system transparent and easy to use.

##How It Works 
When you visit the site and start generating videos, the system tracks who you are based on your internet connection (IP address) and your browser.
The system allows you to generate up to 10 videos per day. Once you reach 10, it will kindly ask you to return tomorrow to generate more.
This limit is designed to protect the service, ensuring that everyone can create videos without any one person using up all the resources.
If you try to make more than 10 videos, you’ll get a message saying that you’ve reached your limit, and you won’t be able to generate more until the next day.


##Conclusion
This project introduces key changes to make the video generation system fairer, more efficient, and scalable. With the introduction of user tracking and rate limiting, it ensures that the service is used responsibly, offering an improved experience for everyone.
